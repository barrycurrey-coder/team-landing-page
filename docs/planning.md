### Features and Elements

### User stories for each feature

### Need to have
Title, List of team members and avatars,individual pages with short bio 

### Nice to have
Dark background, slightly larger font for visibility

Background image of mountains or flowers!

### Won’t have
Any backend functionality (Login etc)

### Assumptions and constraints due to missing information
We assume there will be no extra pages to add other than the landing page and team member page. 
Missing information should be detected at an early stage and fixed before the project is due.

### Functional Requirements
The team landing page must have a title, a row of avatars and names that will link to that person's page when you click on their avatar. 

### Optional/Extra Features
Adjusting colors and fonts to change the look and feel will enhance the visual layout.

Constraints and Assumptions

The project is due soon so there’s not much time to work on changes. We assume there will be no other pages besides the team landing page and the individual pages. 

Since the project is time bound, we need to be precise, avoid complicated codes and features that may be time consuming.
